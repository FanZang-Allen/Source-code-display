  
Main Strategy:
We mainly write four functions : 
Shift : operate our bot to any given point.
Earn_point : call solver function to earn bytecoins
Scan : use scanner with a given angle and get information back
Return : Deal with respawn interrupt
We first notice that 4x4 squares don't have obstacles in the four corners, and hence design a fix path to prevent our 
bot from hitting the walls. We divide the whole maps into four parts and each part contains four host. Using the shift funtion 
we write, our bot can accurately get the location of all the hosts in each part. As a "Friendly Host Pirate", our bot will not deliberately shoot
the opponents except they block on our way to get host. 

One problem we face is how to resolve respawn interrupt. To keep our bot working normally after respawn, all the regular shift steps
have a fix speed of 10. Once our bot ger shooted, its speed will be set to -1 which can be immediately recogonize by our shift dunction. Then
shift function will call return function to shift the bot back to normal path according to the current location.
